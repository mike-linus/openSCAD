My Tray is a simple and effective customisable tray.  

Key features include:
- fully customisable
- drink holder/s to stop cups slipping
- words/letters can be engraved on the base

The tray is particularly useful for couch potatoes when you need a tray for your drink, food and remote but only have an arm rest or some limited space available.

Enjoy!
