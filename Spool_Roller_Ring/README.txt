Universal Spool Roller Ring Designed by: Mike Thompson 8/8/2013

The spool roller is the ideal platform for simple, low cost, light, convenient and effective spool mounting.  It is easy to build with minimal hardware, requires minimal effort to mount and dismount spools and takes up minimal space.  This design was motivated by the basic simplicity and efficiency of the roller configuration while trying to address the inherent weaknesses in existing designs.  

Some of the key issues with existing designs are:
- lack of parametric designs that can handle all typical spool dimensions
- instability causing the spool to dislodge when the spool weight is low or while using large diameter narrow spools
- inability to mount at any angle which is often required when working in limited space or feed angles are critical
- the need for additional metal components (apart from bearings)
- difficulty in changing spools quickly.

This design addresses these deficiencies by providing increased lateral stability in the base and the addition of retainers to prevent dislodgement, regardless of the spool weight or even base angle. By selecting appropriate values for improved stiffness and strength, the spool can be mounted at any angle, even inverted.

Key features:
- Ring structure provides better stability with minimal filament and suffers less ABS print warping compared to straight edges
- Retainers prevent spool dislodging when weight reduced and allow mounting at any angle
- Inner flanges on bearing holders negate the need for washers on the base
- Fully parametric design allows complete control of all options from minimal lightweight to reinforced multi-angle mounted designs.

Instructions
------------
Alter the values below for the required configuration. The minimal configuration without retainers requires 4 x M8 bolts and nuts and 4 x 608 bearings. If using retainers, use threaded rod between the retainers to secure 2 retainer bearings. See  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:193647 for printable nuts and bolts. All parts are printable except the bearings. I have included an example to produce 8mm nuts, bolts and threaded rod that print well. Recommend using at least 40% fill. Note: The ring style base will require a slightly larger build platform than a radial design. Some objects used in differencing have small values eg. 0.1 added to fix display anomalies when using preview mode (f5) to render with OpenCSG, rather than the full CGAL render (f6).
