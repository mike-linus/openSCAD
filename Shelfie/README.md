Description
------------
Shelfie allows you to design your own storage and shelf systems using a fully parametric design. Simply generate the required Shelfie connectors based on your preferred storage layout using the Customizer button or OpenSCAD directly. It is based on the original concept idea from Milla Niskakoski http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:681835

I was impressed with the simplicity and practicality of Milla's initial design, but ran into some limitations when trying to construct my own shelves. The key issues I encountered were:

- No customisable thicknesses. I wanted to use the scrap wood I had lying around rather than purchase new material.
- No mixed thicknesses. I wanted to use glass shelves with wood sides, but it wasn't possible unless they were the same thickness.
- No wall mounting bracket option. Particularly for tall shelves, this is an important safety feature. Wall brackets also support cross-bracing by - connecting a tensioned line between opposite corners.
- No ability to alter the size of the bracket or the wall thickness to increase strength.
- No ability to attach a shelf or divider midspan. This is a big issue if you have long sections and want to add a shelf or divider in-between.

Key features
------------
Shelfie provides full control over all parameters so you can mix materials of any thickness, add wall mounts, alter the bracket size, mid mount shelves, change the screw hole size etc.

Instructions
------------
Plan the storage layout and the types of brackets required. Select the bracket type and options to suit your particular materials and generate the STL file. The brackets are very easy to print and require no special instructions.Some objects used in differencing have small values eg. 0.01 added to fix display anomalies when using preview mode (f5) to render with OpenCSG, rather than the full CGAL render (f6).
