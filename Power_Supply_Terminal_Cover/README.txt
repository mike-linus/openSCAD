Customisable low profile Terminal Cover for the Power Supply commonly used with the Bukobot and other 3d printers. Includes power socket, flexible power out connection support, switch and power LED without compromising safety or style.

I was looking for a terminal cover and found a few on Thingiverse. Unfortunately none had what I needed or had serious weaknesses. For example, they were either too large, didn't protect the terminals completely, didn't provide a power socket or lacked an externally visible power LED. This cover supports all features and allows you to adjust all settings to support your own switch dimensions etc.

DISCLAIMER: 
Please ensure you are careful with all wiring as any power supply modifications involve dangerous voltages. Do not perform these modifications unless you know what you are doing. Proceed at your own risk. I do not accept any liability.

TO CREATE:
Simply change the cutout parameters in OpenSCAD to suit. Note: do not change length, height, depth and thickness parameters for the base unless you want to change the core dimensions.

TO INSTALL:
I sourced the power connector from an old printer and was able to bend the rear connectors so they fitted snug in the case (make sure you insulate all connections!). I extended the LED by carefully soldering some connection wires from the base of the existing LED. 

I used a rubber grommet to route the 12v output connection. This also allows additional cables to be routed later if needed. If you create a small hole in the grommet and then pull through the wires, it will be nicely sealed and will grab sufficiently to prevent the cables being pulled off the terminal block. If you don't have a grommet, a cable tie will suffice to prevent the cable being pulled through.

I added screw holes to the slot retainers for extra safety to ensure the cover cannot be easily dislodged.

Enjoy!
