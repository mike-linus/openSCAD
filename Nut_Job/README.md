Defaults are for a 8mm diameter bolts, rod, matching nuts and wing nuts that work well together
without cleanup or modification. Some default parameters such as the nut outer diameter are deliberately
altered to produce a snug fit that can still be hand tightened. This may need to be altered
depending on individual printer variances, slicing tools, filament etc. Suggest printing a matching
bolt and nut and adjusting as necessary.  Note: slow print speeds, low temperatures and solid
fill are recommended for best results.
