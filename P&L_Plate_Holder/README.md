P-Plate and L-Plate Holder
====================================================
P-Plate and L-Plate Holder v1.0 by Mike Thompson 3/1/2015

The Plate Holder is designed to hold the standard 150mm x 150mm Australian L or P plates. 

The key advantage is the ability to slide the plate in and out without having to remove the mounting mechanism.  This is particularly handy when frequently changing plates between drivers.

The attachment locations and hole size are customisable for various suction cup or hook sizes and placements.
