'Simple Fillet' Library
=======================
by Mike Thompson 3/1/2014, Thingiverse: mike_linus

This library generates basic fillets using the following functions:
- linear_fillet (straight edges)
- corner_fillet (90 degree corners)
- ring_fillet (cylinders)
- profile (generates the 2d profile used to set the fillet shape)
 
There are more advanced fillet libraries and functions available such as the excellent:

however, sometimes you just need a basic fillet with a low computational overhead that can be applied 
quickly and easily to selected objects :)
