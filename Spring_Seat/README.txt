Description
-----------

A very simple but useful component. The spring seat maintains spring alignment and even pressure when the spring is compressed.

Instructions
------------

Change the OpenSCAD variable values to produce an inside or outside seat of the required dimensions. The inside seat option is more compact for tighter spaces. The outside version hides the base of the spring but looks chunkier.
